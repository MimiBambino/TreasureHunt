This is my adaption of the classic arcade game, Frogger.  It was created as an assignment for the Front
End Web Developer Nanodegree at Udacity.  

To play the game, clone the repository and then open the index.html file in your browser or visit this url to play the live version: http://mimibambino.github.io/TreasureHunt.  When you close the instructions modal bugs who want to eat you appear on the screen. A gem will also appear on the screen.  The objective of the game is to collect as many gems as you can.  You move your character with the arrow keys on your keyboard.  If you collect enough gems, you earn a star gun.  You can shoot bugs with the star gun by pressing the space bar.

I hope you enjoy the game!
